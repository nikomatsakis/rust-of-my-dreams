This is a playground -- I started thinking about a series of related changes and found I wanted to try and paint them in one place. None of this represents a consensus of any form. In fact, I'm not even sure if *I* like them all! Consider it a sketch of ideas that could make their way into Rust at some point.

Also, I do not claim intellectual credit for the ideas here. Some are mine, some originated with others, and in some cases I've been inspired by something someone else said but put my own spin on it. I'll try to leave credit.
